# App-Marketplace

App Marketplace is a platform designed to simplify the deployment and management of applications. It leverages Installomator, SwiftDialog, and Shortcuts to provide a seamless experience for users to select and install software on macOS devices.

Current Use:
1. Copy/Deploy "app-store.png" and "appStore.sh" to "/usr/local/App Marketplace/"
2. Deploy and/or run "App Marketplace.shortcut" and "Add Shortcut".
3. Run the Shortcut.

Note: App-Marketplace will install Installomator and SwiftDialog if not already installed.

You may also package this together with "postinstall.sh".
